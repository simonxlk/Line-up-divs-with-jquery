# Line-up-divs-with-jquery
Imagine you have two columns, one has more content than the other but you want them to have the same height, you can't set a height in CSS because that would make the height static. This JQuery solution checks which column is taller and then adjusts the other one, this is a dynamic solution, so whenever you change the content, the divs will adjust.
